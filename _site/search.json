We each learned R without the tidyverse and have all spent quite a few years teaching without it at a variety of levels from undergraduate introductory statistics courses to graduate statistical computing courses. This paper is a synthesis of the reasons supporting our tidyverse choice, along with benefits and challenges associated with teaching statistics with the tidyverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÇetinkaya-Rundel, M., Hardin, J., Baumer, B.
